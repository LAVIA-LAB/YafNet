# PHDIndic_11-Dataset: page-level handwritten document image dataset of 11 official Indic scripts
External Dataset used for Handwritten Script Augmentation

# Abstract
A page-level handwritten document image dataset (PHDIndic_11), of 11 official Indic scripts: Bangla, Devanagari, Roman, Urdu, Oriya, Gurumukhi, Gujarati, Tamil, Telugu, Malayalam and Kannada. PHDIndic_11 is composed of 1458 document text-pages written by 463 individuals from various parts of India. Beside script identification, the dataset can be effectively used in many other applications of document image analysis such as script sentence recognition/understanding, text-line segmentation, word segmentation/recognition, word spotting, handwritten and machine printed texts separation and writer identification.
